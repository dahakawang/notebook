### Elementary functions 

Elementary functions can represent many real world phenomena, concluded by mathematicians&scientists in 18th century.

1. Algebraic functions (polynomia, radical, rational)
2. Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.)
3. Exponential and logarithmic functions


# CH2 Limits and their properties

### Limits fail to exist
1. Different right & left behavior
2. Unbounded behavior
3. Oscillating behavior

### Calculation of limits
1. we use substitute method 
2. if f(x)=g(x) except when x=c, then limit(fx)|x->c == limit(gx)|x->c (common dividor, rationalizing)
3. squeenze theorem

### Continuity at x = c means
1. if f(c) is defined
2. if ![\lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clim_%7Bx%5Crightarrow%20c%7Df%28x%29)is defined
3. if ![\lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clim_%7Bx%5Crightarrow%20c%7Df%28x%29) = f(c)

### Left&Right limits
1. the limits iexts if and only if the left and right limit on the same position
2. the function is continuous on [a, b] if and only the function is continous on (a, b), and its left limit on x=b equals f(b) and its right limit on x=a equals f(a)
