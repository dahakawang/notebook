Elementary functions can represent many real world phenomena, concluded by mathematicians&scientists in 18th century.

1. Algebraic functions (polynomia, radical, rational)
2. Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.)
3. Exponential and logarithmic functions


# CH2 Limits and their properties
### Limits fail to exist

1. Different right & left behavior
2. Unbounded behavior
3. Oscillating behavior
