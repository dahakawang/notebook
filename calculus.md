### Elementary functions 

Elementary functions can represent many real world phenomena, concluded by mathematicians&scientists in 18th century.

1. Algebraic functions (polynomia, radical, rational)
2. Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.)
3. Exponential and logarithmic functions


# CH2 Limits and their properties

### Limits fail to exist
1. Different right & left behavior
2. Unbounded behavior
3. Oscillating behavior

### Calculation of limits
1. we use substitute method 
2. if f(x)=g(x) except when x=c, then limit(fx)|x->c == limit(gx)|x->c (common dividor, rationalizing)
3. squeenze theorem (f(x)=xsin(x) )

### Continuity at x = c means
1. if f(c) is defined
2. if ![\lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clim_%7Bx%5Crightarrow%20c%7Df%28x%29)is defined
3. if ![\lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clim_%7Bx%5Crightarrow%20c%7Df%28x%29) = f(c)

### Left&Right limits
1. the limit at a exists if and only if the left and right limit equals at a
2. the function is continuous on [a, b] if and only the function is continous on (a, b), and its left limit at b equals f(b) and its right limit at a equals f(a)

### The intermediate value theorem
if f is continous on [a, b], and k is any number between f(a) and f(b), then there is at least one number c in [a, b], such that f(x)=k


### infinite limit
1. ![\lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x)=\infty](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clim_%7Bx%5Crightarrow%20c%7Df%28x%29%3D%5Cinfty) means for any M, there exist a delta > 0 such that if 0 <= |x-c| <= delta then f(x) > M
2. be sure to know that this mean the limit fail to exist
